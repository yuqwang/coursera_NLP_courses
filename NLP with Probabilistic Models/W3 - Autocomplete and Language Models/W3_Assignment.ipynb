    # Language Models Auto-Completen,
    n,
    In this assignment, you will build an auto-complete system.  Auto-complete system is something you may see every dayn,
    - When you google something, you often have suggestions to help you complete your search. n,
    - When you are writing an email, you get suggestions telling you possible endings to your sentence.  n,
    n,
    By the end of this assignment, you will develop a prototype of such a system.n,

    A key building block for an auto-complete system is a language model.n,
    A language model assigns the probability to a sequence of words, in a way that more likely sequences receive higher scores.  For example, n,
    I have a pen n,
    is expected to have a higher probability than n,
    I am a penn,
    since the first one seems to be a more natural sentence in the real world.n,
    n,
    You can take advantage of this probability calculation to develop an auto-complete system.  n,
    Suppose the user typed n,
    I eat scrambledn,
    Then you can find a word `x`  such that I eat scrambled x receives the highest probability.  If x = eggs, the sentence would ben,
    I eat scrambled eggsn,
    n,
    While a variety of language models have been developed, this assignment uses N-grams, a simple but powerful method for language modeling.n,
    - N-grams are also used in machine translation and speech recognition. n,
    n,
    n,
    Here are the steps of this assignmentn,
    n,
    1. Load and preprocess datan,
        - Load and tokenize data.n,
        - Split the sentences into train and test sets.n,
        - Replace words with a low frequency by an unknown marker `unk`.n,
    1. Develop N-gram based language modelsn,
        - Compute the count of n-grams from a given data set.n,
        - Estimate the conditional probability of a next word with k-smoothing.n,
    1. Evaluate the N-gram models by computing the perplexity score.n,
    1. Use your own model to suggest an upcoming word given your sentence.

    ### Handling 'Out of Vocabulary' wordsn,
    n,

    ## Part 2 Develop n-gram based language modelsn,
    n,
    In this section, you will develop the n-grams language model.n,
    - Assume the probability of the next word depends only on the previous n-gram.n,
    - The previous n-gram is the series of the previous 'n' words.n,
    n,
    The conditional probability for the word at position 't' in the sentence, given that the words preceding it are $w_{t-1}, w_{t-2} cdots w_{t-n}$ isn,
    n,
    $$ P(w_t  w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n}) tag{1}$$n,
    n,
    You can estimate this probability  by counting the occurrences of these series of words in the training data.n,
    - The probability can be estimated as a ratio, wheren,
    - The numerator is the number of times word 't' appears after words t-1 through t-n appear in the training data.n,
    - The denominator is the number of times word t-1 through t-n appears in the training data.n,
    n,
    $$ hat{P}(w_t  w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n}) = frac{C(w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n}, w_n)}{C(w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n})} tag{2} $$n,
    n,
    - The function $C(cdots)$ denotes the number of occurence of the given sequence. n,
    - $hat{P}$ means the estimation of $P$. n,
    - Notice that denominator of the equation (2) is the number of occurence of the previous $n$ words, and the numerator is the same sequence followed by the word $w_t$.n,
    n,
    Later, you will modify the equation (2) by adding k-smoothing, which avoids errors when any counts are zero.n,
    n,
    The equation (2) tells us that to estimate probabilities based on n-grams, you need the counts of n-grams (for denominator) and (n+1)-grams (for numerator).

    ### Exercise 08n,
    Next, you will implement a function that computes the counts of n-grams for an arbitrary number $n$.n,
    n,
    When computing the counts for n-grams, prepare the sentence beforehand by prepending $n-1$ starting markers s to indicate the beginning of the sentence.  n,
    - For example, in the bi-gram model (N=2), a sequence with two start tokens ss should predict the first word of a sentence.n,
    - So, if the sentence is I like food, modify it to be ss I like food.n,
    - Also prepare the sentence for counting by appending an end token e so that the model can predict when to finish a sentence.n,
    n,
    Technical note In this implementation, you will store the counts as a dictionary.n,
    - The key of each key-value pair in the dictionary is a tuple of n words (and not a list)n,
    - The value in the key-value pair is the number of occurrences.  n,
    - The reason for using a tuple as a key instead of a list is because a list in Python is a mutable object (it can be changed after it is first created).  A tuple is immutable, so it cannot be altered after it is first created.  This makes a tuple suitable as a data type for the key in a dictionary.

    ### Exercise 09n,
    n,
    Next, estimate the probability of a word given the prior 'n' words using the n-gram counts.n,
    n,
    $$ hat{P}(w_t  w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n}) = frac{C(w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n}, w_n)}{C(w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n})} tag{2} $$n,
    n,
    This formula doesn't work when a count of an n-gram is zero..n,
    - Suppose we encounter an n-gram that did not occur in the training data.  n,
    - Then, the equation (2) cannot be evaluated (it becomes zero divided by zero).n,
    n,
    A way to handle zero counts is to add k-smoothing.  n,
    - K-smoothing adds a positive constant $k$ to each numerator and $k times V$ in the denominator, where $V$ is the number of words in the vocabulary.n,
    n,
    $$ hat{P}(w_t  w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n}) = frac{C(w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n}, w_n) + k}{C(w_{t-1}dots w_{t-n}) + kV} tag{3} $$n,
    n,
    n,
    For n-grams that have a zero count, the equation (3) becomes $frac{1}{V}$.n,
    - This means that any n-gram with zero count has the same probability of $frac{1}{V}$.n,
    n,
    Define a function that computes the probability estimate (3) from n-gram counts and a constant $k$.n,
    n,
    - The function takes in a dictionary 'n_gram_counts', where the key is the n-gram and the value is the count of that n-gram.n,
    - The function also takes another dictionary n_plus1_gram_counts, which you'll use to find the count for the previous n-gram plus the current word.

    ## Part 3 Perplexityn,
    n,
    In this section, you will generate the perplexity score to evaluate your model on the test set. n,
    - You will also use back-off when needed. n,
    - Perplexity is used as an evaluation metric of your language model. n,
    - To calculate the  the perplexity score of the test set on an n-gram model, use n,
    n,
    $$ PP(W) =sqrt[N]{ prod_{t=n+1}^N frac{1}{P(w_t  w_{t-n} cdots w_{t-1})} } tag{4}$$n,
    n,
    - where $N$ is the length of the sentence.n,
    - $n$ is the number of words in the n-gram (e.g. 2 for a bigram).n,
    - In math, the numbering starts at one and not zero.n,
    n,
    In code, array indexing starts at zero, so the code will use ranges for $t$ according to this formulan,
    n,
    $$ PP(W) =sqrt[N]{ prod_{t=n}^{N-1} frac{1}{P(w_t  w_{t-n} cdots w_{t-1})} } tag{4.1}$$n,
    n,
    The higher the probabilities are, the lower the perplexity will be. n,
    - The more the n-grams tell us about the sentence, the lower the perplexity score will be.
